## Cryptographic Failures

**What It Is**  
Cryptographic failures happen when encryption is used incorrectly or not at all. This includes weak algorithms, hard-coded keys, poor key handling, or unencrypted sensitive data. These flaws let attackers access information that should be private.

**Why It Matters**  
Web applications rely on cryptography everywhere: protecting network traffic, securing stored data, verifying identities, and safeguarding secrets. When these controls fail, sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or personal information can be exposed, leading to account takeovers or full-scale breaches.

Attackers can exploit these flaws through man-in-the-middle attacks, brute-force attacks on weak keys, or by simply discovering secrets that were never properly protected.

**Common Patterns** 

- Using deprecated or weak algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, or ECB mode
- Hard-coded secrets in code or configuration
- Poor key rotation or management practices
- Lack of encryption for sensitive data at rest or in transit
- Self-signed or invalid TLS certificates
- Using AI/ML systems without proper secret handling for model parameters or sensitive inputs

**How To Prevent It**

- Use strong, modern algorithms such as AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, or enforce TLS 1.3 with valid certificates
- Use secure key management services like Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS, or HashiCorp Vault
- Rotate secrets and keys regularly, following defined crypto periods
- Document and enforce policies and standard operating procedures for key lifecycle management
- Maintain a complete inventory of certificates, keys, and their owners
- Ensure AI models and automation agents never expose unencrypted secrets or sensitive data
- The web application in this room contains a weakness of this type for you to explore.

## Challenge
