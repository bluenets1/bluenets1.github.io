## Security Misconfigurations

**What It Is**  
Security misconfigurations happen when systems, servers, or applications are deployed with unsafe defaults, incomplete settings, or exposed services. These are not code bugs but mistakes in how the environment, software, or network is set up. They create easy entry points for attackers.

**Why It Matters**  
Even small misconfigurations can expose sensitive data, enable privilege escalation, or give attackers a foothold into the system. Modern applications rely on complex stacks, cloud services, and third-party APIs. A single exposed admin panel, an open storage bucket, or misconfigured permissions can compromise the entire system.

**Example**  
In 2017, [Uber](https://www.huntress.com/threat-library/data-breach/uber-data-breach) exposed a backup AWS S3 bucket with sensitive user data, including driver and rider information, because the bucket was publicly accessible. Attackers could download data directly without needing credentials. This shows how a deployment mistake can lead to a significant breach.

**Common Patterns**

- Default credentials or weak passwords left unchanged
- Unnecessary services or endpoints exposed to the internet
- Misconfigured cloud storage or permissions (S3, Azure Blob, GCP buckets)
- Unrestricted API access or missing authentication/authorisation
- Verbose error messages exposing stack traces or system details
- Outdated software, frameworks, or containers with known vulnerabilities
- Exposed AI/ML endpoints without proper access controls

**How To Prevent It**

- Harden default configurations and remove unused features or services
- Enforce strong authentication and least privilege across all systems
- Limit network exposure and segment sensitive resources
- Keep software, frameworks, and containers up to date with patches
- Hide stack traces and system information from error messages
- Audit cloud configurations and permissions regularly
- Secure AI endpoints and automation services with proper access controls and monitoring
- Integrate configuration reviews and automated security checks into your deployment pipeline

#### Challenge
##### Navigate to `10.49.170.253:5002`. It appears that the developers left too many traces in their User Management APIs.
