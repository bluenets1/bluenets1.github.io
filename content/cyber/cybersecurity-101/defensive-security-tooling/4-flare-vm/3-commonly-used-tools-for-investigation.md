Let's examine the tools we will focus on in this room. These tools are the basic ones used for initial investigations. See the list below.

|**Tool**|**Investigative Value**|
|---|---|
|Procmon|A helpful tool for tracking system activity, especially regarding malware research, troubleshooting, and forensic investigations.|
|Process Explorer|Allows you to see the Process of the Parent-child relationship, DLLs loaded, and its path.|
|HxD|Malicious files can be examined or altered via hex editing.|
|Wireshark|Observing and investigating network traffic to look for unusual activity.|
|CFF Explorer|Can generate file hashes for integrity verification, authenticate the source of system files, and validate their validity.|
|PEStudio|Static analysis or studying executable file properties without running the files.|
|FLOSS|Extracts and de-obfuscates all strings from malware programs using advanced static analysis techniques.|

  

You can follow along and open the tools and files on the FlareVM while we discuss the overview of some of these tools.
## Process Monitor (Procmon)
A powerful Windows tool designed to help you record issues with your system's apps. It lets you **see, record, and keep track of system and Windows file activity in real-time**. Process Monitor is helpful for **tracking system activity, especially regarding malware research, troubleshooting, and forensic investigations**. It keeps real-time tabs on the file system, registry, and thread/process activity.

Here's how to utilize it effectively for investigation.

![the image shows how to leverage the tool. Here, we filtered for the process lsass.exe to see information about it.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727302306550.png)

According to this log entry, the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)- related process lsass.exe has successfully read a file. LSASS handles authentication and frequently communicates with crucial system files such as lsasrv.dll (Local Security Authority Server Service).

Although this is a standard system process, LSASS may be the target of credential dumping attacks if you are examining logs for indications of malicious activity. Mimikatz and other tools frequently try to access LSASS memory. In these situations, you should watch for any additional suspicious activity related to LSASS, such as odd access patterns or processes reading or writing to lsass.exe.

Don’t worry—the sample above does not show any malware signs!

  

## Process Explorer (Procexp)

Process Explorer offers in-depth insights into the active processes running on your computer. It allows you to delve into the inner workings of your system, providing a comprehensive list of currently running processes and their linked user accounts. If you've ever been curious about which program is accessing a specific file or folder, Process Explorer can provide us with that information.

![The image shows the process and it's parent. We can validate the process ID and other information of the process here](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727171765939.png)

As you can see from the image above, the CFF Explorer app is open. Using **Process Explorer(procexp),** located on the desktop, we identified the process and its parent process. This is usually pretty useful when we want to monitor what other processes are being spawned, such as from a Word document, an LNK file, or even an ISO file, as threat actors typically abuse these.
## HxD

HxD is a quick and flexible hex editor for editing files, memory, and drives of any capacity. It can be applied to forensic investigation, data recovery, debugging, and exact manipulation of binary data. Important features include viewing file and memory contents, editing, searching, and comparing hex data. Let's look at how the tool works.

![The image shows the hex value of a file](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727170785692.png)

This HxD hex editor snapshot shows the binary file **possible_medusa.txt**. The hex data on the left indicates the file's contents in hexadecimal, and the ASCII interpretation appears on the right. Interestingly, the file starts with **4D 5A (Little Endian)**, indicating it is executable.

The **Data Inspector** on the right allows you to examine individual bytes by displaying their values in many data types (e.g., integer, float), facilitating a more straightforward data evaluation.

By permitting in-depth examination of a file's unprocessed hexadecimal data, HxD facilitates inquiry by identifying file kinds, structures, and possible corruption. Its Data Inspector feature helps by offering insights into particular byte values.

  

## CFF Explorer

With the help of CFF Explorer's comprehensive file information, investigators can generate file hashes for integrity verification, authenticate the source of system files, and validate their validity (e.g., by looking for unusual alterations). This is important to know when analyzing malware since dangerous code may be hidden in altered system files.

![the image shows the information of the file when opened using the CFF explorer tool.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727170785706.png)

The **cryptominer.bin** file's details are displayed in the sample. On September 23, 2024, a 64-bit Portable Executable file was generated. The file's information can be verified by its hashes (SHA-1 and MD5). During investigations, this tool aids in confirming file information lookup and locating possible problems.

  

## Wireshark

Regarding network traffic analysis, Wireshark is a powerful tool that investigators may use to hunt down dubious connections, examine protocols, and spot possible assaults or data exfiltration. In this case, TLSv1.2 suggests a secure, encrypted connection that can mask harmful activity or safeguard legitimate traffic.

![the image shows the capabilities of wireshark such as capturing the network traffic. We can see here the source and destination IP and also the port and protocol used.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727170785704.png)

This Shows captured packets with details about the protocol, source, destination, and other information. Most packets show that TLSv1.2 and TCP are being used for encrypted transmission. The raw packet data is shown in ASCII and hexadecimal forms, with a significant chunk encrypted using TLSv1.2.

You can check our Wireshark module [here](https://tryhackme.com/module/wireshark) if you would like to dig deeper into this tool.

  

## PEStudio

Static analysis, or studying executable file properties without running the files, is done with PEstudio. This feature is beneficial in several situations. PEstudio offers a variety of information about a file without putting users in danger of execution, which aids in identifying executables that seem suspect or harmful.

So, how does it work? Let's look at the image below.

![this image shows information about the certain file that you wish to examine.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727170785666.png)

This example shows the examination of an executable file, PSexec.exe ( **not in the VM; this is a pure example only**), using PEstudio 9.22, a static malware analysis tool. The file has a dual purpose—legitimate for system administrators but potentially exploited by hackers for remote access.

The file's **entropy value of 6.596** indicates a remote chance of packing or encryption, which is typical of dangerous software. **Version 2.34** of this 32-bit console-based application allows it to run programs remotely, a feature frequently used to migrate laterally during attacks. The file is assembled using **Visual C++ 8**.

The dual-use nature of **PsExec**, typically legitimate but suspicious in compromised environments, combined with **low to medium indicators** and moderately high entropy, makes its presence on a system concerning, especially if remote code execution is not expected. Its use in **post-exploitation phases** warrants further investigation to determine if it’s being misused maliciously.****

  

## FLOSS

Using advanced static analysis techniques, the FLARE Obfuscated String Solver (FLOSS, formerly FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver) automatically extracts and de-obfuscates all strings from malware programs. Like strings.exe, it can enhance the basic static analysis of unknown binaries. FLOSS also includes more Python scripts in the script's directory, which can be used to load the script's output into other programs like IDA Pro or Binary Ninja.

In the example above, FLOSS extracted **189 static strings** from the binary, which may contain hardcoded information such as file **paths**, **URLs** (likely for command-and-control servers), **IP addresses**, **API calls**, **error messages**, **registry, encryption keys**, and **configuration data**. However, no decoded strings were identified, suggesting that FLOSS did not detect or decode dynamically generated or obfuscated strings during this analysis. Malware frequently uses obfuscated strings to conceal its malicious behavior.
