## Log Sources
Every device in the network generates some kind of log whenever an activity is performed on it, such as a user visiting a website, connecting to SSH, logging into their workstation, etc. Let's see what the logs of some common devices that are found in a network environment look like.

## Windows Machine
Windows records every event that can be viewed through the Event Viewer. It assigns a unique ID to each type of log activity, making it easy for the analyst to examine and keep track of. To view events in a Windows environment, type `Event Viewer` in the search bar. This takes you to the tool where different logs are stored and can be viewed, as shown below. These logs from all Windows endpoints are forwarded to the SIEM solution for monitoring and better visibility.

## Linux Machine
Linux OS stores all the related logs, such as events, errors, warnings, etc. These are then ingested into SIEM for continuous monitoring. Some of the common locations where Linux stores logs are:
- /var/log/httpd: Contains HTTP Request  / Response and error logs.
- /var/log/cron: Events related to cron jobs are stored in this location.
- /var/log/auth.log and /var/log/secure: Stores authentication-related logs.
- /var/log/kern: This file stores kernel-related events.

Here is a sample of a cron log:
**Cron Logs**

```shell-session
May 28 13:04:20 ebr crond[2843]: /usr/sbin/crond 4.4 dillon's cron daemon, started with loglevel noticeMay 28 13:04:20 ebr crond[2843]: no timestamp found (user root job sys-hourly)May 28 13:04:20 ebr crond[2843]: no timestamp found (user root job sys-daily) May 28 13:04:20 ebr crond[2843]: no timestamp found (user root job sys-weekly) May 28 13:04:20 ebr crond[2843]: no timestamp found (user root job sys-monthlyJun 13 07:46:22 ebr crond[3592]: unable to exec /usr/sbin/sendmail: cron output for user root job sys-daily to /dev/null
```

## Web Server
It is important to monitor all requests/responses coming in and out of the web server for any potential web attack attempt. In Linux, common locations to write all apache-related logs are /var/log/apache or /var/log/httpd.

Here is an example of Apache Logs:
**ApacheLogs**
```shell-session
192.168.21.200 - - [21/March/2022:10:17:10 -0300] "GET /cgi-bin/try/ HTTP/1.0" 200 3395 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.102 Safari/537.36"127.0.0.1 - - [21/March/2022:10:22:04 -0300] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 2216 "-" "curl/7.68.0"
```

## Log Ingestion
All these logs provide a wealth of information and can help identify security issues. Each SIEM solution has its own way of ingesting the logs. Some common methods used by these SIEM solutions are explained below:
1. **Agent / Forwarder**  
    These SIEM solutions provide a lightweight tool called an agent (forwarder by Splunk) that gets installed on the Endpoint. It is configured to capture and send all the important logs to the SIEM server.
2. **Syslog**  
    Syslog is a widely used protocol to collect data from various systems like web servers, databases, etc., and send real-time data to the centralized destination.
3. **Manual Upload**  
    Some SIEM solutions, like Splunk, ELK, etc., allow users to ingest offline data for quick analysis. Once the data is ingested, it is normalized and made available for analysis.
4. **Port-Forwarding**  
    SIEM solutions can also be configured to listen on a certain port, and then the endpoints forward the data to the SIEM instance on the listening port.

An example of how Splunk provides various methods for log Ingestion is shown below:
