## Behind the Triggered Alerts
We learned that a SIEM solution detects threats by correlating logs from the log sources and triggers alerts, but do we know the magic behind these detections?
**SIEM** solution has detection rules that catch threats. These rules play an important role in the timely detection of threats, allowing analysts to take action on time. Detection rules are pretty much logical expressions set to be triggered. A few examples of detection rules are:

- If a user gets five failed Login Attempts in 10 seconds, raise an alert for `Multiple Failed Login Attempts`
- If login is successful after multiple failed login attempts, raise an alert for `Successful Login After multiple Login Attempts`
- A rule is set to alert every time a user plugs in a USB (Useful if USB is restricted as per the company policy)
- If outbound traffic is > 25 MB, raise an alert to potential data exfiltration Attempt (Usually, it depends on the company policy)

## How is a detection rule created?
To explain how the rule works, consider the following Eventlog use cases:
## Use-Case 1
Adversaries tend to remove the logs during the post-exploitation phase to remove their tracks. A unique Event ID **104** is logged every time a user tries to remove or clear event logs. To create a rule based on this activity, we can set the condition as follows:
**Rule:** If the Log source is WinEventLog **AND** EventID is **104** - Trigger an alert `Event Log Cleared`
## Use-Case 2:
Adversaries use commands like `whoami` after the exploitation/privilege escalation phase. The following Fields will be helpful to include in the rule.
- Log source: Identify the log source capturing the event logs
- Event ID: Which Event ID is associated with Process Execution activity? In this case, Event ID 4688 will be helpful.
- NewProcessName: Which process name will be helpful to include in the rule?

**Rule:** If Log Source is WinEventLog **AND** EventCode is **4688,** and NewProcessName contains **whoami,** then Trigger an ALERT `WHOAMI command Execution DETECTED`

In the previous task, the importance of field-value pairs was discussed. Detection rules keep an eye on the values of certain fields to get triggered. That is the reason why it is important to have normalized logs ingested.
## Alert Investigation
When monitoring SIEM, analysts spend most of their time on dashboards, as they display various key details about the network in a very summarized way. Once an alert is triggered, the events/flows associated with the alert are examined, and the rule is checked to see which conditions are met. Based on the investigation, the analyst determines if it's a True or False positive. Some of the actions that are performed after the analysis are:

- Alert is a False Positive. It may require tuning the rule to avoid similar False positives from occurring again.
- Alert is a True Positive. Perform further investigation.
- Contact the asset owner to inquire about the activity.
- Suspicious activity is confirmed. Isolate the infected host.
- Block the suspicious IP.

=> Which Event ID is generated when event logs are removed?
:=> 104

=> What type of alert may require tuning?
:=> False Positive
