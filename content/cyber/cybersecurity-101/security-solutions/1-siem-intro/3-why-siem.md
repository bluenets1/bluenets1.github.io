In the previous task, we saw how different log sources generate numerous logs of various types and the challenges associated with analyzing those logs. So, how can we more efficiently manage this flood of data and extract valuable results?

This is where SIEM comes into play. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a security solution that collects logs from various types of log sources, standardizes their format into a consistent one, correlates them, and detects malicious activities using detection rules.

## Features of SIEM

The SIEM solution not only solves the issues we discussed in the previous task but also provides capabilities to enhance security operations. Let's discuss some of the core features that a SIEM provides.

- **Centralized Log Collection**  
    SIEM collects logs from all sources (endpoints, servers, firewalls, etc.) and centralizes them in one place. These logs are pulled through lightweight agents or APIs and populated into the SIEM solution. This solves the problem of jumping on every machine individually to analyze its logs.   
      
    
- **Normalization of Logs**  
    Raw logs are of different formats and sizes. A Windows log does not look the same as a Linux log. Since a SIEM solution centralizes these logs in one place, it also ensures that all the logs are broken down into different fields and presented in one consistent format. Breaking down a log into several fields for ease of understanding is known as Parsing, and converting all the logs of various log sources into one consistent format is known as Normalization.   
      
    
- **Correlation of Logs**  
    Individual logs are not very useful. SIEM correlates the logs of different sources and finds any relationship between them. This helps to identify malicious activity by analyzing its pattern. For instance, let's take a look at the following activities happening in a system during a 5-minute timeframe.   
    - Haris logs in via VPN from an IP that he never has previously used
    - Haris accesses some documents on a shared drive
    - Haris executed a PowerShell script
    - The system makes an outbound network connection

Individually assessed, these activities look fine, but the SIEM solution would correlate these activities, which could point to a potential data exfiltration activity resulting from Haris's compromised VPN credentials.

- **Real-time Alerting  
    **SIEM detects malicious activities based on the rules it contains. Many rules come with a SIEM by default. However, analysts make new detection rules based on their requirements to mature future detections. When the conditions for these detection rules are satisfied, alerts are triggered, and the analysts are notified. Analysts can then investigate these alerts within the SIEM platform.    
      
    
- **Dashboards and Reporting  
    **Dashboards are the most important components of any SIEM. SIEM presents the data for analysis after being normalized and ingested. The summary of this analysis is presented in the form of actionable insights with the help of multiple dashboards. Each SIEM solution comes with some default dashboards and provides an option for custom Dashboard creation. Below is some of the information that can be found in a dashboard:

- Alert Highlights
- System Notification
- Health Alert
- List of Failed Login Attempts
- Events Ingested Count
- Rules triggered
- Top Domains Visited

An example of a dashboard made in Splunk SIEM is shown below:

There are several other features of a SIEM that we will not cover in detail in this room. These features include integration with threat intelligence feeds, extensive data retention, powerful searching capabilities, and many others. 

In the next task, we will discuss different log sources by examining their logs and see how they are ingested into a SIEM solution.
