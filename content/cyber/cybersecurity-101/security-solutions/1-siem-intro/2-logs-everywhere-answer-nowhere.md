## Logs Everywhere

Multiple devices in a network communicate with each other and, most of the time, with the Internet through a router. The image below shows an example of a simple network that comprises multiple Linux/Windows-based Endpoints, one data server, and one website.

These devices continuously generate logs of the activities that occur within them. We can also call these devices log sources. The logs they generate serve as a trail of all the activities and are extremely helpful for identifying malicious activities or general troubleshooting. These log sources are mainly divided into two categories, which are discussed below.

## 1) Host-Centric Log Sources

These log sources capture events that occurred within or related to the host. Devices that generate host-centric logs include Windows, Linux, servers, etc. Some examples of host-centric logs are:

- A user accessing a file
- A user attempting to authenticate.
- A process execution activity
- A process adding/editing/deleting a registry key or value.
- PowerShell execution

## 2) Network-Centric Log Sources

Network-related logs are generated when the hosts communicate with each other or access the internet to visit a website. Devices that generate network-centric logs are firewalls, IDS/IPS, routers, etc. Some examples of network-centric logs are:

- SSH connection
- A file being accessed via FTP
- Web traffic
- A user accessing the company's resources through VPN.
- Network file sharing Activity

Together, these host-centric and network-centric log sources constantly create numerous logs in a network. 

## Answers Nowhere

Until now, it seems pretty straightforward that these log sources generate logs, we analyze them, and identify malicious activities. However, it's not that simple. It has some challenges. Some of them are discussed below:

- **Numerous Log Sources** A network has many log sources, which generate hundreds of events per second. These logs are scattered across different devices, and examining the logs on each device one by one in case of an incident can be tedious.  
- **No Centralization** As logs reside on the machines on which they are generated,  you may need to connect with each log source via SSH, RDP, etc., to analyze logs from multiple log sources. This is very inefficient and can waste a lot of your valuable time during the investigations.  
- **Limited Context** Individual logs cannot tell the whole story of an activity. During any incident, the individual activities on different log sources may seem harmless. But if these logs are correlated, they can indicate a whole different story. For instance, you observed a file access event in a system, which is generally normal activity. However, if you correlate different log sources, you might come to know that this file was accessed by a user who accessed this machine through lateral movement after compromising another machine in the network.    
- **Limited Analysis** The log sources generate numerous logs per second, and analyzing all the logs from all the devices manually to identify any abnormal activity is nearly impossible for humans. Realistically, the analysts will miss a lot of important logs in between the analyses due to their huge number.  
- **Format Issues** Different log sources generate logs in various formats. Analysts need to know all these formats to analyze them, which can be extremely difficult, especially when dealing with numerous log sources in a network.

In the next task, we will learn about a powerful technology that can solve all these problems.
