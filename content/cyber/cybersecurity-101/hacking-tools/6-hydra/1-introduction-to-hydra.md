## What is Hydra?

Hydra is a brute force online password cracking program, a quick system login password “hacking” tool.

Hydra can run through a list and “brute force” some authentication services. Imagine trying to manually guess someone’s password on a particular service (SSH, Web Application Form, FTP or SNMP) - we can use Hydra to run through a password list and speed this process up for us, determining the correct password.

According to its [official repository](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra), Hydra supports, i.e., has the ability to brute force the following protocols: “Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP, HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-POST, HTTP-PROXY, HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD, HTTPS-POST, HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MEMCACHED, MONGODB, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, Oracle, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, Radmin, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5, SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, TeamSpeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.”

For more information on the options of each protocol in Hydra, you can check the [Kali Hydra tool page](https://en.kali.tools/?p=220).

This shows the importance of using a strong password; if your password is common, doesn’t contain special characters and is not above eight characters, it will be prone to be guessed. A one-hundred-million-password list contains common passwords, so when an out-of-the-box application uses an easy password to log in, change it from the default! CCTV cameras and web frameworks often use `admin:password` as the default login credentials, which is obviously not strong enough.

## Installing Hydra

Hydra is already installed on the AttackBox. You can access it by clicking on the **Start AttackBox** button.

If you prefer to use the in-browser Kali machine, Hydra also comes pre-installed, as is the case with all Kali distributions. You can access it by selecting Use Kali Linux and clicking on **Start Kali Linux** button.

However, you can check its official repositories if you prefer to use another Linux distribution. For instance, you can install Hydra on an Ubuntu or Fedora system by executing `apt install hydra` or `dnf install hydra`. Furthermore, you can download it from its official [THC-Hydra repository](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra).
