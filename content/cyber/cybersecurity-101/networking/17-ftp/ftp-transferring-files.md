Unlike HTTP, which is designed to retrieve web pages, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is designed to transfer files. As a result, FTP is very efficient for file transfer, and when all conditions are equal, it can achieve higher speeds than HTTP.

Example commands defined by the FTP protocol are:

- `USER` is used to input the username
- `PASS` is used to enter the password
- `RETR` (retrieve) is used to download a file from the FTP server to the client.
- `STOR` (store) is used to upload a file from the client to the FTP server.

FTP server listens on TCP port 21 by default; data transfer is conducted via another connection from the client to the server.

In the terminal below we executed the command `ftp 10.201.16.63` to connect to the remote FTP server using the local `ftp` client. Then we went through the following steps:

- We used the username `anonymous` to log in
- We didn’t need to provide any password
- Issuing `ls` returned a list of files available for download
- `type ascii` switched to ASCII mode as this is a text file
- `get coffee.txt` allowed us to retrieve the file we want

The command exchange via the FTP client is shown in the terminal below.

Terminal

We used Wireshark to examine the exchanged messages more closely. The client’s messages are in **red**, while the server’s responses are in **blue**. Notice how various commands differ between the client and the server. For example, when you type `ls` on the client, the client sends `LIST` to the server. One last thing to note is that the directory listing and the file we downloaded are sent over a separate connection each.
