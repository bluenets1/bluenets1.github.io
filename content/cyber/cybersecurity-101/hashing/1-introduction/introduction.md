Consider the scenario where you just downloaded a 6 GB file and want to know whether the copy you downloaded is identical to the original file, bit for bit. How would you do that? Or if a good Samaritan handed you this 6 GB file on a USB memory drive, how can you be sure it is identical to the file you want to download?

The answer to both of the above questions lies in comparing the hash values of the two files; if two hash values are equal, you can say with very high certainty that the two files are identical. But what is a hash value?

A **hash value** is a fixed-size string or characters that is computed by a hash function. A **hash function** takes an input of an arbitrary size and returns an output of fixed length, i.e., a hash value. We will cover various exciting and clever uses of hash functions and values in this room.

Note about terminology: We favoured the terms hash function and hash value. However, we occasionally use the word **_hash_** as a _verb_ to mean _calculate_ the hash value; moreover, we occasionally use the word **_hash_** by itself as a _noun_ to refer to the hash value.
