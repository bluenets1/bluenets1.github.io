Control flow in JS refers to the order in which statements and code blocks are executed based on certain conditions. JS provides several control flow structures such as `if-else`, `switch` statements to make decisions, and loops like `for`, `while`, and `do...while` to repeat actions. Proper use of control flow ensures that a program can handle various conditions effectively.

## **Conditional Statements in Action**

One of the most used conditional statements is the `if-else` statements, which allows you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition evaluates to `true` or `false`.

To test this practically, let's create a file `age.html` on the Desktop of the attached VM and paste the following code:

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Age Verification</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Age Verification</h1>
    <p id="message"></p>

    <script>
        age = prompt("What is your age")
        if (age >= 18) {
            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "You are an adult.";
        } else {
            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "You are a minor.";
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Double-click the file to open it in Google Chrome. You will see the following image:

In the above code, a prompt will ask for your age. If your age is greater than or equal to 18, it will display a message saying, "`You are an adult.`" Otherwise, it will show a different message. This behavior is controlled by the if-else statement, which checks the value of the age variable and displays the appropriate message based on the condition.

## **Bypassing Login Forms**

Suppose a developer has implemented authentication functionality in JS, where only users with the username "`admin`" and passwords matching a specific value are allowed to log in. To see this in action, open the `login.html` file in the exercises folder.

When you double-click the file and open it in your browser, it will prompt you for a username and password. If the correct credentials are entered, it will display a message confirming that you are logged in, as shown below:
