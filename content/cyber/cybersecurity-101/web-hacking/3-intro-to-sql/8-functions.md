When working with Data, functions can help us streamline queries and operations and manipulate data. Let's explore some of these functions next.

### String Functions

Strings functions perform operations on a string, returning a value associated with it.

#### CONCAT() Function

This function is used to add two or more strings together. It is useful to combine text from different columns.  

Terminal

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT CONCAT(name, " is a type of ", category, " book.") AS book_info FROM books;
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| book_info                                                         |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Android Security Internals is a type of Defensive Security book. |
| Bug Bounty Bootcamp is a type of Offensive Security book.        |
| Car Hacker's Handbook is a type of Offensive Security book.      |
| Designing Secure Software is a type of Defensive Security book.  |
| Ethical Hacking is a type of Offensive Security book.            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

5 rows in set (0.00 sec)  
```

  

This query concatenates the **name** and **category** columns from the **books** table into a single one named **book_info**.

#### GROUP_CONCAT() Function

This function can help us to concatenate data from multiple rows into one field. Let's explore an example of its usage.  

Terminal

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT category, GROUP_CONCAT(name SEPARATOR ", ") AS books
    FROM books
    GROUP BY category;
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| category           | books                                                       |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Defensive Security | Android Security Internals, Designing Secure Software       |
| Offensive Security | Bug Bounty Bootcamp, Car Hacker's Handbook, Ethical Hacking |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

  

The query above groups the **books** by **category** and concatenates the titles of books within each category into a **single string**.

#### SUBSTRING() Function

This function will retrieve a substring from a string within a query, starting at a determined position. The length of this substring can also be specified.  

Terminal

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT SUBSTRING(published_date, 1, 4) AS published_year FROM books;
+----------------+
| published_year |
+----------------+
| 2014           |
| 2021           |
| 2016           |
| 2021           |
| 2021           |
+----------------+

5 rows in set (0.00 sec)  
```

  

In the query above, we can observe how it extracts the first **four** characters from the **published_date** column and stores them in the **published_year** column.

#### LENGTH() Function

This function returns the number of characters in a string. This includes spaces and punctuation. We can find an example below.  

Terminal

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT LENGTH(name) AS name_length FROM books;
+-------------+
| name_length |
+-------------+
|          26 |
|          19 |
|          21 |
|          25 |
|          15 |
+-------------+

5 rows in set (0.00 sec)  
```

  

As we can observe above, the query calculates the length of the string within the **name** column and stores it in a column named **name_length**.

#### Aggregate Functions

These functions aggregate the value of multiple rows within one specified criteria in the query; It can combine multiple values into one result.

#### COUNT() Function

This function returns the number of records within an expression, as the example below shows.  

Terminal

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_books FROM books;
+-------------+
| total_books |
+-------------+
|           5 |
+-------------+

1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

  

This query above counts the total number of rows in the **books** table. The result is **5**, as there are five books in the books table, and it's stored in the **total_books** column.

#### SUM() Function

This function sums all values (not NULL) of a determined column.

**Note:** There is no need to execute this query. This is just for example purposes.

Terminal

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT SUM(price) AS total_price FROM books;
+-------------+
| total_price |
+-------------+
|      249.95 |
+-------------+

1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

  

The query above calculates the total sum of the **price** column. The result provides the aggregate price of all books in the column **total_price**.

#### MAX() Function

This function calculates the maximum value within a provided column in an expression.  

Terminal

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT MAX(published_date) AS latest_book FROM books;
+-------------+
| latest_book |
+-------------+
| 2021-12-21  |
+-------------+

1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

  

The query above retrieves the latest publication (maximum value) date from the **books** table. The result **2021-12-21** is stored in the column **latest_book**.

#### MIN() Function

This function calculates the minimum value within a provided column in an expression.  

Terminal

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT MIN(published_date) AS earliest_book FROM books;
+---------------+
| earliest_book |
+---------------+
| 2014-10-14    |
+---------------+

1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

  The query above retrieves the earliest publication (minimum value) date from the **books** table. The result **2014-10-14** is stored in the **earliest_book** column.
