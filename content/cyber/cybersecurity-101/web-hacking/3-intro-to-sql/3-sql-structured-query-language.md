## What is SQL?

Now, all of this theoretically sounds great, but in practice, how do databases work? How would you go and make your first table and populate it with data? What would you use? Databases are usually controlled using a *Database Management System (DBMS)*. Serving as an interface between the end user and the database, a DBMS is a software program that allows users to retrieve, update and manage the data being stored. Some examples of DBMSs include MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle Database and Maria DB. 

![An illustration introducing SQL with databases. The image shows a central database icon connected to multiple tables, each with rows and columns representing data.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36/room-content/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36-1727687095405.png)

The interaction between the end user and the database can be done using SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a programming language that can be used to query, define and manipulate the data stored in a relational database. 

## The Benefits of SQL and Relational Databases

SQL is almost as ubiquitous as databases themselves, and for good reason. Here are some of the benefits that come with learning and using to use SQL:  

- **It's _fast_:** Relational databases (aka those that SQL is used for) can return massive batches of data almost instantaneously due to how little storage space is used and high processing speeds. 
  
- **Easy to Learn:** Unlike many programming languages, SQL is written in plain English, making it much easier to pick up. The highly readable nature of the language means users can concentrate on learning the functions and syntax.
  
- **Reliable:** As mentioned before, relational databases can guarantee a level of accuracy when it comes to data by defining a strict structure into which data sets must fall in order to be inserted.
  
- **Flexible:** SQL provides all kinds of capabilities when it comes to querying a database; this allows users to perform vast data analysis tasks very efficiently.  
Getting Hands ON

![An illustration of a laptop displaying a terminal window used to access and interact with an SQL database.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36/room-content/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36-1727687461547.png)

Now that we’ve covered what SQL is, it’s time to get hands-on and start using it yourself! Click the green "Start Machine" button. The machine will start in Split-Screen view. In case the VM is not visible, use the blue Show Split View button at the top of the page. Once the machine has finished booting up, open the terminal and run the following command:

Start Machine

**Setting up MySQL**

```shell-session
user@tryhackme$ mysql -u root -p
```

Once prompted for the password, enter:

**Setting up MySQL**

```shell-session
user@tryhackme$ tryhackme
```

The output should look as follows:

**Setting up MySQL**

```shell-session
user@tryhackme$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 8

With that covered, you are ready to start using (and learning) SQL!
